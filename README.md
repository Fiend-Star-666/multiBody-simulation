This project simulates bouncing balls within a bounded area using the Pygame library. The simulation includes handling
ball creation, boundary collisions, ball collisions, and real-time user interactions

Controls
P: Pause/Resume the simulation.
T: Toggle ball trails.
Space: Start the simulation after loading.
